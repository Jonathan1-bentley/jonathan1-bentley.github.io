# Planning

_NOTE: Many of these steps reference the [Bouncing Box Project](https://jsbin.com/goyuhod/3/edit?html,output)_

Always start any programming task by clarifying what you want to do and then breaking it down into small steps. Small steps can get you just about anywhere if youâ€™ve got enough time. If you get stuck, break it down smaller!

With your partner, create a file called `planning.txt` where you write down your answers to these questions

### User Story / Gameplay
- Describe the gameplay
- What are the conditions when the game begins? 
- Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
- What `if`s will there be? if ball hits paddle ball bounce else if ball hits edge p1/p2 score +=1

### Visual Game Components:
- What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
  - Which will be static? (the board)
  - Which will be animated? (the box)
- What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were `positionX`, `speedX`, and `points`.

### Events / Logic 
- What events will occur in this game? (timerevents Y, keyboard events y, clic king events n?)
- How do those events affect the data of the program? timer tracks how long ball is in play keyboard moves paddles up/down
- For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!

when the ball is clicked:
1. The speed is increased
2. The ball bounces and game continues
